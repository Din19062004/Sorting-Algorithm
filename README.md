# A simple application to visualize 3 sorting algorithms: insertion sort, bubble sort and quick sort

## Description 
This is a project that simulates the operation of three basic sorting algorithms: insertion sort, bubble sort, and quick sort. The project is implemented using the Java programming language and the interface is built with JavaFX technology, supported by Scene Builder ðŸ˜ƒ

## Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Din19062004/Sorting-Algorithm.git
```

## Requirements:
- Java version 21 or higher (You can use any IDE you prefer; for me, I use Eclipse).
- JavaFX version 21.0.5 (You can download it at the following link: https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/. Note: Please choose the version compatible with your operating system).
- Scene Builder version 23.0.1 (You can download it at the following link: https://gluonhq.com/products/scene-builder/. Note: Please choose the version compatible with your operating system).

## How does it work?
You can open the folder named ```design``` to see the use case diagram and class diagram.
- The use case diagram shows the interaction between user and my application. 
- The class diagram shows the basic design and the relationships between all the classes. The general class diagram only contains classes's name and their relationships. The detail class diagram contains all classes's attributes and behavious.

For more detail, you can open the folder named ```report``` to read the problem statement and operation description.

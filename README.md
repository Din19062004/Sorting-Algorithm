# A simple application to visualize 3 sorting algorithms: insertion sort, bubble sort and quick sort

This is a project that simulates the operation of three basic sorting algorithms: insertion sort, bubble sort, and quicksort. The project is implemented using the Java programming language and the interface is built with JavaFX technology, supported by Scene Builder. It just simply works to demonstrate these three algorithm ðŸ˜ƒ

## Clone the repository into your computer
```
git clone https://github.com/Din19062004/Sorting-Algorithm.git
```

## How does it work?
You can open the folder named ```design``` to see the use case diagram and class diagram.
- The use case diagram shows the interaction between user and my application. 
- The class diagram shows the basic design and the relationships between all the classes.

For more detail, you can open the folder named ```report``` to reader the problem statement and operation description.
